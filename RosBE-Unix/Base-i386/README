                           ReactOS Build Environment
                 Version 2.2.1 for Unix-based operating systems
                      Base package and i386 build tools

Introduction
-------------
  The ReactOS Build Environment ("RosBE") is the official build environment
for compiling ReactOS. This version is targeted at Unix-based operating systems
such as Linux, FreeBSD or macOS.
  The installation process is divided into two parts: First a script builds and
installs the needed compiler tools for your operating system. Therefore you need
the "gcc" compiler for your system and some other build tools.
  Afterwards, you can create a desktop shortcut using another script. This
shortcut opens a Terminal window and prepares all environment settings for
building ReactOS.


Needed Applications and Libraries
----------------------------------
  Make sure that the following applications and libraries are installed on your
system. They are needed to build the ReactOS Build Environment. The
"RosBE-Builder.sh" script automatically checks for their presence:

  * GNU Bash
    The executable file and the package name are often called "bash".
    All scripts are exclusively designed for the Bash shell.

  * GNU GCC
    You need a GCC compiler that is suitable for your system. The executable 
    file and the package name are often called "gcc".
    Your GCC compiler needs to be able to compile both C and C++ sources, hence
    you also need to have the "g++" module installed.
    Make sure you have GCC 7.x or later installed, as earlier versions have not
    been tested.

  * Grep
    The executable file and the package name are often called "grep".

  * GNU Make
    Make sure that you have the GNU version of "make" installed. Operating
    systems like FreeBSD have a different version installed by default.
    The executable file and the package name are often called "make" or
    "gmake".

  * GNU Makeinfo
    The executable file is often called "makeinfo". This file is usually in a
    package called "texinfo".

  * zlib
    The library file is generally called "libz.so". Package names vary, one
    example for Debian-based Linux distributions is "zlib1g-dev".


Installation
-------------
  The Installation of RosBE is very simple as there are scripts that do most of
the work for you. Follow these steps to compile and install RosBE for your
operating system:

  1. Open a Terminal window and run "sudo ./RosBE-Builder.sh" in the directory
     of the unpacked RosBE files.
     NOTE: Becoming a root user through "sudo" is only required for installing
     RosBE into the default directory ("/usr/local/RosBE"). If you want to 
     install it into a personal directory, you don't need superuser privileges.
     Advanced users can also make use of CC, CFLAGS, CXX, and CXXFLAGS
     variables to modulate the way tools will be built.

  2. Follow the directions on the screen until the script ends with "Finished
     successfully!"

  3. Call the "createshortcut.sh" script in the installation directory (usually
     "/usr/local/RosBE") to create a desktop shortcut for the Build Environment.

  Afterwards, you can easily open a Build Environment for ReactOS by clicking
the shortcut.


Uninstallation
---------------
  If you want to uninstall RosBE, just delete the entire installation directory
and any shortcuts you have created.

Tested Operating Systems
-------------------------
  The Build Environment has been designed to work on all Unix-based operating
systems. Nevertheless, it is impossible to test it on all possible systems out
there.
  The current primary development and test system is Ubuntu 18.04. But users
also reported that it works well under other Linux systems such as Fedora or
openSUSE and Unix derivates like FreeBSD or macOS.
  You should be able to compile the build tools on both i386 (32-bit) and
x86_64 (64-bit) systems.

  Special thanks to ROSFan, who created the nice ReactOS Build Environment
Logo.
  Special thanks also goes out to all those who provide so much help by
testing out new versions, you know who you are. Without you, RosBE would not be
what it is.

Environment v0.2-3.4.4.
