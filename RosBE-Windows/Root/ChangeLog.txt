*** May 19th, 2010 - RosBE 1.5.1.1 Released

- fix a bug in ssvn batch version which always ran through the update function even if the 1st param was crap. (Crocodile)
- Fixing another Bug noone saw in the RCs or in RosBE 1.5 Update 1, a bug which exactly shows the bullshit Batch is in real. (Daniel Reimer)
  Results in having to remove the old behavior mode again for now. 64 bit hosts make problems with their (x86) in the path var. (Daniel Reimer)
- Some sSVN cleanup, too. (Daniel Reimer)

*** May 16th, 2010 - RosBE 1.5.1 Released

- Updated NASM to 2.08.01 (Daniel Reimer)
- Updated YASM to 1.0.0 (Daniel Reimer)
- Updated SVN to 1.6.11 (Daniel Reimer)
- Re-added the old behavior of RosBE to ignore the System PATH Variable. Many people will love it as fix for overly stupid installed cygwin and WinAVR Tools. To activate it, make a system Variable named "_ROSBE_NOSYSPATH" and set it to 1. (Daniel Reimer)
- sSVN: Make use of the http:// protocol instead of the svn:// one. (Daniel Reimer)
- Add remakex command to RosBE. (Daniel Reimer)
- Add sound output on finished build. On PS we have one for a successful and one for a failed build. On CMD we have just one for now, if you let it generate a LOG File. (Daniel Reimer)
- Made a small modification to be able to ask for help for PS commands in RosBE, too. (Daniel Reimer)
- Introduce %_BUILDBOT_SVNSKIPMAINTRUNK% as first of maybe more coming Build Bot Vars to skip the updating of the main trunk source when sSVN is used to do so. If its being set to "1" it only updates rosapps and rostests if existent. This is needed for Olaf Siejka's Windows Build Bot project. As Default its set to "0" and thus all behaves as before. (Daniel Reimer)
- Fix a access error when you start two builds in the same minute on a PC by adding the seconds to $TIMENAME, too. (Daniel Reimer)
- Clean up $DATENAME which included the year twice. (Daniel Reimer)
- Weaken the ROS Source Dir check in clean a bit so that it does remove the built stuff even if it did not even build any tool yet. (Daniel Reimer)
- Add the correct license to the audio files. (Daniel Reimer)
- If a custom output folder is defined, pass it to log2lines, too. (Mephisto, Daniel Reimer)
- Feature request by Olaf Siejka. The sSVN parameters "rosapps" and "rostests" were originally made for just creating rosapps / rostests repositories in the modules folder. Now it detects an existent repository and just updates that one. If there's no repository or even no folder for the repository it first generates it and continues. Additionally you can set the revision you want to checkout or update to. "create" accepts a revision as second parameter now, too. (Daniel Reimer)
- Make sSVN fully multiple Source Tree compatible by removing the dependency on the _ROSBE_ROSSOURCEDIR variable. (Daniel Reimer)

- Added RBuild Flags Setting possibility into the "config" command. They will be loaded at RosBE start-up and thus behave the same way like the other settings you can set in there. (Daniel Reimer)

- Get rid of the Doskey macro file, just add %_ROSBE_BASEDIR% (and %_ROSBE_BASEDIR%\Tools for svn.exe) to the PATH and call all .cmd files directly. Renamed some batch files to match the macro names and added some new ones, for which no batch file existed. (except "env", this command has been removed) Now these commands can be called from other batch files and stuff like "clean & make" will work as well. (Colin Finck, Gunnar)

- Fixed a bug which prevented makefile.auto to be deleted by "clean" in the PS Version, this was the reason for the "buildno.h not found" error, too (Daniel Reimer)

- Added a way to enable/disable the Version Show up (Daniel Reimer)

RosBE-Windows spring cleaning:

- Remove the Standard MinGW Build Environment. We don't need it any longer since we have a new GCC. (Colin Finck)
- Get rid of the GCC 3.4.5-specific hacks: A properly compiled GCC 3.4.5 shouldn't need them. (Colin Finck)
- Get rid of the experimental ARM and PPC compiler support: It simply won't work that way and we can re-add that later, when we have proper compilers. (Colin Finck)
- Use setlocal wherever possible, so that we don't need to unload the used variables explicitly. (Colin Finck)
- Make the coding style more consistent. (Colin Finck)
- Commands like "make bootcd livecd install" work again. (Daniel Reimer)

*** February 01st, 2009 - RosBE 1.4 Released

"Quote of the year: A loooong time ago there was something called Batch. It was a old scripting "language" which you could use for some stuff, but with hacks, so ugly, you would turn to stone if used. Then there was the new shiny Powershell Scripting Language which came from the deep resorts of the Devil GaTeS with great features like a XML parser and more. A great war began for the right to be used in the Glorious Heaven of RosBE. After some salves of XML parse and shrapnel of DeHacking, Batch was fainted and vanished. The glorious winner of the war helped to gain worldwide peace and food for the hungry people. After a loong live Powershell died and was replaced by PS 2.0."
